				People want to work with and for companies that believe in something. This is what we believe:</P>
				
				<UL>
				<LI>Cloud computing is the future, and not just for IT. Cloud solutions and the new business models, processes and behaviors they enable can make companies significantly more innovative, effective, agile and responsive.
				<LI>There will always be a better way of doing something. This belief permeates who we are, how we deliver and where we invest. The creation of our Cloud Empowerment Suite and our use of crowdsourcing in projects are just a few examples of how we live this belief every day.
				<LI>Technology solutions should be focused on the user. The best piece of technology is worthless if it’s not used, which is why we work with customers to think through both the technical and the people aspects of any project.
				<LI>You shouldn’t sell what you don’t use yourself. Why would a customer want a partner that didn’t have first-hand knowledge of the technologies they were selling or implementing? We run our business entirely in the cloud and on the solutions that we deliver to customers.
				<LI>Culture is everything. When you set out to build a company bent on disrupting a $3 trillion industry, you need a team that feels as passionately about the goal as you. We spend a disproportionate amount of time making sure we hire the right people and foster a culture focused on customers, team and fun.
